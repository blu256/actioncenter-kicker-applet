!!! WORK in Progress - "usuable", need some polishing (see problems below)

It's a windows 10 "notification center" clone applet for Trinity kicker. As the idea is to provide a quick actions panel more than a 'real' notification center, this is named "action center" :p


testing: compile project
copy libraries / .desktop files to proper locations
create /opt/trinity/share/apps/actioncenter_applet folder and copy assets to it + make the scripts executables.
copy appicon actioncenter.png to /opt/trinity/share/apps/kicker/pics

The idea is that the actions are configurables, you can change the images & scripts associated with them. The first two actions buttons are meant to have off/on states, depending on the return value of the corresponding scripts (action1.sh / action2.sh) with check argument.
the 3 others are just 'simple' shortcuts; Proj.sh is the script responsible for the dual display management, you can configure it for your needs; notif.sh is responsible for the message displayed, initially designed to display if there are updates available, but you can modify it to display whatever you want.

Problems/todo now: 
     - proper updating of the buttons images when clicked (doesn't work now)
     - panel background color
     - using something else than classic buttons (seticon ?..)
     - detecting update-manager icon in systray when updates are availables (notif.sh)
     - opening networkmanager gui instead of nmtui if possible
