!!! WORK in Progress - "usuable", need some polishing (see problems below)

It's a windows 10 "notification center" clone applet for Trinity kicker. As the idea is to provide a quick actions panel more than a 'real' notification center, this is named "action center" :p


testing: compile project
- copy libraries / .desktop files to proper locations
- create /opt/trinity/share/apps/actioncenter_applet folder and copy the content of assets folder to it + make the two scripts actions.sh and proj.sh executables.


The idea is that the actions are configurables, you can change the images & scripts associated with them. The first two actions buttons are meant to have off/on states, depending on the returned values of the actions.sh scripts (called with no argument)
the 3 others are just 'simple' shortcuts (you can edit actions.sh to change behavior) ; actions.sh is responsible too for the message displayed, initially designed to display if there are updates available, but you can modify it to display whatever you want.
Proj.sh is the script responsible for the dual display management, you can configure it for your needs.  

**xdotool needed for now (sudo apt install xdotool)
Problems/todo now: 
     - proper updating of the buttons images when clicked (doesn't work now)
     - panel background color (I want it to follow titlebar color configured in theme); maybe not displaying it as a "real" windows too.
     - using something else than classic buttons
     - better detecting of update-manager icon in systray- done with xdotool yet
     - opening networmanager gui without the need of xdotool ?
