!!! WORK in Progress - unfinished, not usuable now.

testing: compile project
copy libraries / .desktop files to proper locations
create /opt/trinity/share/apps/actioncenter_applet folder and copy assets to it + make the scripts executables.
copy appicon actioncenter.png to /opt/trinity/share/apps/kicker/pics

the first two actions buttons are meant to have off/on states, depending on the return value of the corresponding scripts (action1.sh / action2.sh) with check argument.
the two other are just 'simple' shortcuts

Problems now: 
     - proper updating of the buttons images when clicked (doesn't work now)
     - panel background color
     - using something else than classic buttons (seticon ?..)
To do: detecting update-manager icon in systray when updates are availables.
